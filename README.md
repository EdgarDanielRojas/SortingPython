# SortingPython
Same as the Scheme assignment from programming languages but done in Python

## Uses Python 3
This code was made using Python 3, so it may not work if it is run with python 2, but I don't think there should be conflicts

## Inputs
All of the inputs are hard coded, in order to insert a list, you mus modify the ```listToSort``` variable in the code. It is intended to sort numbers but if it encounters another type of symbol in the list, it converts into a 0.

## Outputs
The program prints the sorted list.
